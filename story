It all started when one day, a rabbit challenged a turtle named Toby to compete on a race.
The rabbit was sure that it would win, so he said that if that rabbit wins, then the turtle has to bring 5 carrots a day. and if the turtle wins( which was very unlikely), 
the rabbit has to be his slave for a day.
